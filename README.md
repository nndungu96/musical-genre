Investigating the relevance of musical genre through the lyrics of pop and hip-hop songs from 1990 - 2020

# Description

Is musical genre still relevant? Increased access to music from around the world and increased use of streaming services have lead to implications that the boundaries between genres are no longer as strong as they once were. LDA topic modelling is used on a corpus of song lyrics from both Hip-Hop and Pop music from 1990-2020 to identify the key topics discussed in both genres. The frequency each topics appears in a given year is represented as a time series of topic distributions. Using the Jensen â€“ Shannon divergence metric the similarity of the topics in both genres over time is calculated to show that the topics in are converging in these genres.
